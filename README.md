# Quantum-Droplets
The objective of this experiment is to recreate analogous behavior to quantum phenomena with fluids on an Arduino Powered vibrating surface.

## Project
This project is an innitiative of LMU's Society of Physics Students chapter to visualize and better understand the De Broglieâ€“Bohm, [pilot-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_wave) interpretation of Quantum Theory.<br>
